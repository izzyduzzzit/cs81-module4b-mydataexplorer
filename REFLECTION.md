# Izarra Villareal CS 81 JavaScript Module 4 Assignment 4B: My Personal Data Objects

# Were your predictions right?
My predictions were pretty much right. I had to redo this assignment though becuase of the issues I had last week with Git so they aren't really predictions.

# What surprised you?
I think what surprises me most is my morning caffeine ritual. It can't be healthy after so many years.

# What was tricky or rewarding?
I think the issues I originally had with Git were tricky to figure out. It was very rewarding figuring out how to resolve those issues and come back to finish these missing assignments. I hope I still get some credit for these.

# How did using your own data change things?
Using my own data made my predictions a little easier because I kind of already know my bad habits and weekly routine.
